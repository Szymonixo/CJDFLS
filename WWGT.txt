Tekst:

Just sit straight in the saddle
Hold on tight and we'll get there
Don't look back if the road behind is dark and sad
Look ahead, there's the future
Looking bright, full of colours
You will see
A broken heart always heals up with a little time
You live and you learn, have a blast
You fall and get up
The road is what matters at last
And we will get there
We will get there
It doesn't matter
We will get there
And I promise you, one day
You're gonna laugh again
Every stone, every sand grain, oh
That we pass on our journey
It's the ups and the downs that makes you feel alive
You live and you learn, have a blast
You fall and get up
The road is what matters at last
And we will get there
We will get there
It doesn't matter
We will get there
And I promise you, one day
You're gonna laugh again
Keep holding on
You can't go wrong
'Cause what you know is true
Is true for you
Don't let it go
And stand up for what you believe in
And what you have seen is true
And we will get there
We will get there
It doesn't matter
We will get there
And I promise you, one day
You're gonna laugh again
And we will get there
We will get there
It doesn't matter
We will get there
We will get there
We will get there
And I promise you, one day
You're gonna laugh again
